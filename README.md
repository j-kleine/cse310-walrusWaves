# Overview

WalrusWaves is a web application that provides real-time marine weather data, including water temperature, wind speeds, and general weather conditions. The goal of this project was to create a simple and user-friendly tool for me as a winter swimmer, to check current sea conditions before heading out.

This project was built to enhance my understanding of JavaScript, API integration, and front-end development while working with real-world data sources. By integrating the two weather APIs, I learned how to fetch and process external data, handle asynchronous JavaScript operations, and dynamically update the user interface.

# Future Work

- Improve the "Select Location" bar (add more cities/locations or implement a free search function).
- Integrate an API call to display the next ~4 tide events.
- Add an option in settings to toggle or rearrange metrics in the weather display table.
- Replace the current weather icon with animated graphics for better user experience.
